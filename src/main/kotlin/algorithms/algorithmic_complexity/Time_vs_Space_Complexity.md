# Time vs. Space Complexity (ELI15)

Imagine you're at a bookstore. You want to find a specific book.

**Time Complexity** is like the number of steps you take to find the book. 

*   **Good time complexity:** You know the book is in the "Science Fiction" section, so you go straight there. That's fast!
*   **Bad time complexity:** You have no idea where the book is, so you have to check every single bookshelf in the store. That takes a long time.

**Space Complexity** is like the amount of space you need to help you search.

*   **Good space complexity:** You just remember the title of the book in your head. You don't need any extra tools.
*   **Bad space complexity:** You have a huge, heavy notebook with a list of every book in the store, and you have to carry it around with you. That takes up a lot of space!

In programming, we want algorithms that are both fast (good time complexity) and don't use too much memory (good space complexity).
