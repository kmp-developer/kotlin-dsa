# Big-Θ (Theta) Notation (ELI15)

Big-Θ (Theta) is the most precise way to describe an algorithm's complexity. It means that the algorithm's performance is sandwiched between a best-case and a worst-case scenario.

If an algorithm has a Big-Θ complexity, it means that its performance is very predictable. For example, if an algorithm is **Θ(n)**, it means that it will always take about the same amount of time, proportional to the number of items, no matter what.

Think of it as a guarantee. You know exactly how your algorithm will behave.
