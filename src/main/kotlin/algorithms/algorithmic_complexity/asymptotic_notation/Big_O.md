# Big-O Notation (ELI15)

Big-O is like a rating for your algorithm. It tells you how much slower your algorithm will get as you give it more stuff to work on.

*   **O(1) - Excellent:** Your algorithm is super fast and doesn't slow down, no matter how much stuff you give it.
*   **O(log n) - Good:** Your algorithm is very fast. It slows down a little bit as you give it more stuff, but not much.
*   **O(n) - Fair:** Your algorithm is okay. It slows down in a predictable way as you give it more stuff.
*   **O(n^2) - Bad:** Your algorithm is getting slow. It slows down a lot as you give it more stuff.
*   **O(2^n) or O(n!) - Terrible:** Your algorithm is extremely slow. It will take forever with even a small amount of stuff.

We use Big-O to talk about the **worst-case scenario**. It's a way of saying, "My algorithm will never be slower than this."
