# Big-立 (Omega) Notation (ELI15)

Big-立 (Omega) is the opposite of Big-O. It tells you the **best-case scenario** for your algorithm. It's a way of saying, "My algorithm will never be faster than this."

For example, if you're looking for a number in a list, the best case is that the number is the very first thing you look at. That would be **立(1)**.

While Big-O is more commonly used because we're often concerned about the worst-case performance, Big-立 is still useful for understanding the full picture of an algorithm's efficiency.
